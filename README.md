# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Using the Breast Cancer Database, we will create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer. We will use various Machine Learning Algorithms to analyse and predict. We have to use 30 different columns to understand the data.
